Use  instead.\r\n* Breaking change:  has been moved from the  cache option to the root of the options object. Custom cache keys are now applied to the service worker in addition to the edge. \r\n* Add ability to deep fetch based on JSON results (#400)\r\n* Add forcePrefetchRatio install option (#393)\r\n* Add custom cache keys to service worker (#392)\r\n* Add transformRequest to ProxyOptions, allow for POST caching in project code (#387)\r\n* Add support for Next.js rewrites and redirects (#404)\r\n\r\n\r\n"
